# MovieSearchApp
Use your Android device to search for movie titles on IMDB using the OMDb API. 
The result is a grid page of small panels with the movie title, year of production and a movie poster.
Images are loaded with the help with the Picasso, a powerful library for downloading and caching images for Android.
Styled to match the MovieSearch wep application: https://github.com/Spalding13/MovieSearch 

This app uses the Open Movie Database API for data: http://www.omdbapi.com/ 

A mobile version will be released soon for Android devices!
